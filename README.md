# Kanbas - Learning Management System (LMS) Project

## Overview

Kanbas is a functional Learning Management System (LMS) inspired by a popular LMS widely used in educational institutions. Built with React, this project aims to provide a robust platform for managing and delivering educational content. The aim is to start simple, then keep building. The first branch will be a simple HTML rendering of the site. We will then add styling using CSS. Then we'll go for the real deal, using JavaScript/TypeScript and various libraries (notably React and Node) as well as MongoDB to build a modern, functional web app utilizing the MERN stack. 

I'll be updating the README as we go! 

## Getting Started

The vanilla HTML version is deployed on netlify: https://comfy-bonbon-d2bf33.netlify.app/kanbas/courses/home/screen

In the next version, we'll refactor using CSS.
