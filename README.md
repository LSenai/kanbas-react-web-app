# Kanbas - Learning Management System (LMS) Project

## Overview

Kanbas is a functional Learning Management System (LMS) inspired by a popular LMS widely used in educational institutions. Built with React, this project aims to provide a robust platform for managing and delivering educational content. The aim is to start simple, then keep building. The first branch will be a simple HTML rendering of the site. We will then add styling using CSS. Then we'll go for the real deal, using JavaScript/TypeScript and various libraries (notably React and Node) as well as MongoDB to build a modern, functional web app utilizing the MERN stack. 

I'll be updating the README as we go! 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/kanbas.git

2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd kanbas

3. Install dependencies

### Running the App:
In the project directory, run:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
If it doesn't happen automatically, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app. The page will reload when you make changes.

### Available Scripts
* **npm test**: launches the test runner in interactive watch mode
* **npm run build**: Builds the app for production, ready for deployment.

### Deployment

For now, the site is intended to run only on your local machine. Future updates will include deployment on platforms like Netlify.

### Customization

If you want to customize the build tool and configuration choices, you can use the eject command. Keep in mind that this is a one-way operation, and you won't be able to go back. The curated feature set is suitable for small to middle deployments, but full customization is available when you're ready for it.
