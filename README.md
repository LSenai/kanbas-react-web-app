# Kanbas - Learning Management System (LMS) Project
## Starting to add some JavaScript
Here's the latest deployment. We've got the beginnings of a single page application! Up next, we'll start incorporating more state management, and eventually, a proper relational DB.

## Overview

Kanbas is a functional Learning Management System (LMS) inspired by a popular LMS widely used in educational institutions. Built with React, this project aims to provide a robust platform for managing and delivering educational content. The aim is to start simple, then keep building. The first branch will be a simple HTML rendering of the site. We will then add styling using CSS. Then we'll go for the real deal, using JavaScript/TypeScript and various libraries (notably React and Node) as well as MongoDB to build a modern, functional web app utilizing the MERN stack.
