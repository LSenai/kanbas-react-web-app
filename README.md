# Kanbas - Learning Management System (LMS) Project
## We've got a server!
A5 is live! https://assignment-5--comfy-bonbon-d2bf33.netlify.app/#/Kanbas/Dashboard

This time we've built and deployed a server and configured APIs using Express.js.

For the next (and perhaps final?) installment, we'll use a proper Mongo database to have long-term persistence, and will probably also implement different user types and user authentication.

## Overview

Kanbas is a functional Learning Management System (LMS) inspired by a popular LMS widely used in educational institutions. Built with React, this project aims to provide a robust platform for managing and delivering educational content. The aim is to start simple, then keep building. The first branch will be a simple HTML rendering of the site. We will then add styling using CSS. Then we'll go for the real deal, using JavaScript/TypeScript and various libraries (notably React and Node) as well as MongoDB to build a modern, functional web app utilizing the MERN stack.
